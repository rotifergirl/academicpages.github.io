I am a first generation academic who was introduced to the nomadic lifestyle before I could even write full sentences. I've grown up in three different countries (Belgium, The USA, and New Zealand), and have since also lived in Norway and Austria. After finishing high school in sunny Nelson, NZ, I moved down to Dunedin and The University of Otago to pursue a Bachelor of Science majoring in Genetics. Along the way, I also studied some Psychology, Portuguese, Zoology, and Biochemistry. Then I moved to Norway for about a year and a half, and now I'm doing my PhD here in Austria.

My Research
======
For my Honours project, which in New Zealand is similar to a Masters, I joined the Dearden Lab at the University of Otago and got a crash course in evo-devo. Here, I looked at the early development of the anterior-posterior axis in a rotifer species. I was looking at the expression patterns of two different marker genes for these regions. During my time in the Dearden Lab I also helped with the annotation of the [Bumblee Genome](https://rotifergirl.github.io/publications.html). While in Dunedin, I also completed a summer internship at AgResearch looking at genomic causes of a specific phenotype in sheep. 

After some time off, helping my parents with the beverage company, and working in a cheese factory (it's much like a lab, just on a bigger scale, and you can eat the product instead of publishing it!), I started my PhD. I am currently in the Stelzer Lab, again working with rotifers (a happy coincidence, I'm not picky about my study species), but this time looking into [genome size evolution](https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-11-90). The lab group works on different aspects of genome size changes and biology within this species complex, but I am currently working on discovering the genomic causes of these changes. This means I'm doing a lot of comparative genomics. Watch this space for results soon!
