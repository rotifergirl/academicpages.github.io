title: "Genome size evolution- towards new model systems for old questions "
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-GSVAR_rev
excerpt: 'The amount of DNA in our cells (genome size) has intrigued biologists for many decades. Previously, it wasnâ€™t understood why seemingly less-complex organisms (like onions) had more DNA than more complex organisms (like humans), but it was then found to be caused by non-coding DNA. Where does this extra DNA come from? And what are its other effects on the organism? In this review, I have discussed these issues and how we can combine new and old technologies to try to answer these questions. Hopefully this will lead to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on non-coding DNA.'
