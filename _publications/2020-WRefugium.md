excerpt: 'It is a broadly observed pattern that the non-recombining regions of sex-limited chromosomes (Y and W) accumulate more repeats than the rest of the genome, even in species like birds with a low genome-wide repeat content. Here we show that in birds with highly heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the W chromosome has a transposable element (TE) density of &amp;gt;55% compared to the genome-wide density of &amp;lt;10%, and contains over half of all full-length (thus potentially active) endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) of the entire genome. Using RNA-seq and protein mass spectrometry data, we were able to detect signatures of female-specific ERV expression. We hypothesise that the avian W chromosome acts as a refugium for active ERVs, likely leading to female-biased mutational load that may influence female physiology similar to the &quot;toxic-Y&quot; effect in Drosophila. Furthermore, Haldane&#039;s rule predicts that the heterogametic sex has reduced fertility in hybrids. We propose that the excess of W-linked active ERVs over the rest of the genome may be an additional explanatory variable for Haldane&#039;s rule, with consequences for genetic incompatibilities between species through TE/repressor mismatches in hybrids. Together, our results suggest that the sequence content of female-specific W chromosomes can have effects far beyond sex determination and gene dosage.'
