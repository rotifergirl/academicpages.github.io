I presented this poster at the 2017 Congress of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) in Groningen. The poster focused on ongoing comparative genomics of 14 rotifer genomes, taking a mostly coverage-based approach to identify genomic regions potentially contributing to genome size change in the *Brachionus plicatilis* species complex.
