I gave this talk at the 3rd annual Uppsala Transposon Symposium, covering most of my PhD work on *B. plicatilis* genome size variation. This covered the genomic causes of interspecific genome size variation (mostly transposons), genomic causes of intraspecific genome size variation (annotating B chromosomes), and some analyses of meiotic behaviour of B chromosomes.
