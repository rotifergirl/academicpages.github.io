I helped teach the computer-based and lab-based practical elements of this two-week course for students studying towards a Bachelor of Biology at the University of Innsbruck. I assisted with prokaryotic and eukaryotic bioinformatics, as well as flow cytometry to measure genome size of various fish species.
